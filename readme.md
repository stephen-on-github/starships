# Starships supply stops calculator
Application, which uses the [_Star Wars_ API](https://swapi.co/) (Swapi) for calculating the number of stops necessary for _Star Wars_ starships to travel a given distance.

## Challenge
> We want to know for all _Star Wars_ starships, to cover a given distance, how many stops for resupply are required.
>
> The application will take as input a distance in mega lights (MGLT).
>
> The output should be a collection of all the starships and the total amount of stops required to make the distance between the planets.
>
> Sample output for 1000000 input:
>
>* Y-wing: 74
>* Millennium Falcon: 9
>* Rebel Transport: 11
